Project: Notex ðŸ“Œ
Description:
	Notex is a sleek and intuitive Chrome extension designed to help you save important text 
	from any webpage with just a click. Simply highlight the content you want to keep, and a 
	discreet button will appear next to your cursor. With one click, the selected text is 
	securely stored in your browserâ€™s storage, ensuring itâ€™s always there when you need it. 
	When you close your browser, your saved content is automatically transferred to a local 
	file, making it accessible even after a shutdown. Perfect for research, quick notes, or 
	saving valuable information without leaving the page.
